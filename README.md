## What's all the fuss with sorting?

    - Its's not a big problem, when it comes to a small set of data.
    - When it gets bigger and bigger like tons of website, it becomes a problem.
    - Such as Google, Apple store, Amazon products, Microsoft data centres, Netflix shows.
    - Cannot use built-in sort(), Need custom sorted methods based on the data so that they can lower their costs and the operations their computers need to do.
    - Sort it to make it meaningful to access easily.
    - Something wrong, or in a inefficient way means losing money.

    - Elemantory Sorts: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.

## Bubble Sort

    - Bubble up the highest number, and go to the begining and bubble up again til it's sorted.
    - One of the simplest sorting algorithm but also one of the least efficient.
    - Comparing items in nested loops one by one.
    - Time complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

## Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort

    - This works by scanning a list of items for the smallest element and then swapping that element for the one in the first position.

    - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

## Merge Sort
