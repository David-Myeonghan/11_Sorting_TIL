## What's all the fuss with sorting?

    - Its's not a big problem, when it comes to a small set of data.
    - When it gets bigger and bigger like tons of website, it becomes a problem.
    - Such as Google, Apple store, Amazon products, Microsoft data centres, Netflix shows.
    - Cannot use built-in sort(), Need custom sorted methods based on the data so that they can lower their costs and the operations their computers need to do.
    - Sort it to make it meaningful to access easily.
    - Something wrong, or in a inefficient way means losing money.
